export const ABOUT_ME_TEXT = `
I was born and raised in Norwalk, CT. I grew up 
with a huge curiosity for technology and innovation. I took my first Computer 
Science class as a freshman in High School back in 2012. following this I went on to 
study Computer Science at the University of Connecticut and graduated in 2020.
Over the years I have contributed work in many research opportunies within cyber sercurity,
network engineering and work as a react developer in the industry.    
On my spare time, I like to read books, play music, workout and maintain an art account 
on Instagram (@pseudokoder on IG). I want to document and perhaps provide insight
of my experience as a software engineer to help other like-minded individuals.
